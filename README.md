 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kayke Oliveira. 

I am a Mechatronics Engineer graduated from IFCE.
Currently, I'm dedicating myself daily to the Java programming language with the objective of migrating from the area and becoming a back-end developer.

I'm looking for an internship opportunity as a back-end developer.
